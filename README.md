OpenView SDK is designed to help create custom applications for non-destructive inspections of industrial and commercial materials.

This tutorial will help you build a Focus PX application based on OpenView SDK from scratch.

The source codes are available in Github: [FocusPXDemo](https://github.com/ospqul/FocusPXDemo/tree/master).

Documents material: [doc](https://github.com/ospqul/FocusPXDemo/tree/master/doc).

Video courses are also available [here](https://github.com/ospqul/FocusPXDemoVideos/tree/master/Videos).

You could clone a local repo: `git clone https://github.com/ospqul/FocusPXDemo.git`

You could also check out the source code branched out for each lesson.
